/*
  Score Display component - Displays the team names, wins and losses, and, if applicable, the score metadata associated with each game.

  Depending on the game status state, different content will appear:
  - Default (Pre-Game): Start time and game location are displayed, as well as the Home Team (with Wins-Losses) and Away Team (with Wins-Losses) will appear. Team Logos will appear to the left of each team name.
  - In-Progress: The start time and game location from Pre-Game will be replaced with the current inning (e.g., Top 1st, Bottom 3rd). In addition to the team information from Pre-Game, the runs, hits, and errors for each team will display.
  - Final: The current inning will be replaced with "Final", with an indicator of innings if the game went to extra innings (e.g., "Final" vs "Final/10"). The losing team's text color will lighten, making the winning team's linescore appear to be bolded. An indicator (a left-facing triangle) will also appear next to the winning team's linescore.
